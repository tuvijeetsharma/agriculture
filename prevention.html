<h1><b>What is Food Wastage?</b></h1>
<p>Food waste is one of the biggest cause of concern in the world.
	In Hindu culture, wasting food on our plate <br> is considered to be a sin.
	Many religions such as Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism believe <br> that wasting food will lead us to hell after our death.
	Children should be thought, right <br> from their childhood, not to waste food on their plate.
	Given the fact that more than 20 million people <br> in India are below the poverty line, it is a disappointing statistics to see how much food is wasted in India. <br>
	The Government of India has come up with many schemes to collect food waste <br> and distribute it to the poor and needy.
	As the saying goes charity begins at home, food waste should be <br> controlled in our home.
	Food is considered as god and throwing it away without <br> consuming it is as good as committing a sin.
	Students in schools, colleges and universities should be thought <br> about the negative impact of food waste that will have on society.
	Dumping of food waste leads to <br> land pollution and soil pollution.</p>

<h1><b>Effects of Wasting Food</b></h1>
 <p><b>Food waste has significant implications that directly impact society on a number of levels. <br> It has direct impacts on the environment and contributes to climate change; <br> wastes economic capital and the finite resources used in food production;<br> and, finally, it increases global food insecurity.</b>Wasting food also raises social questions, <br> particularly given the current global financial crisis, rising food prices and international food shortages. <br> If only one-fourth of the food lost or wasted globally was consumed <br> it would be sufficient to feed 870 million people, 12 per cent of the world's current population. <br> One of the top contributors to food wastage is because of a lack of appropriate planning on the consumer part. <br> Sometimes people buy lots of food without appropriately making plans on when and how <br> the food will be prepared for consumption. Coupled with the contemporary <br> schedules of work and appointments, people, therefore, tend to change food <br> preparation plans or fail to remember using it on time.</p>
